### 🧭 About Me

I’m a dedicated and ambitious software engineering student focused on building systems that solve real-world problems.  
My work blends technical precision with creativity, from designing healthcare management tools to building Discord automation systems and AI-driven projects.

I’m currently developing hands-on experience in:
- **Full-Stack Development** with Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL  
- **C# Systems Development** using Visual Studio and SQLite  
- **AI & Machine Learning** projects (classical and quantum)  
- **Cloud & DevOps** through Neon, AWS, and Azure fundamentals  

I’m passionate about turning ideas into reliable, scalable solutions while continuously learning and contributing to impactful software teams.
